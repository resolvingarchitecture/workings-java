# Big O Notation
Description of the efficiency of an algorithm.

* Big O: Describes an upper bound on the time (but largely used as Big Theta in industry).
* Big Omega: Describes a lower bound on the time.
* Big Theta: Describes the combination of both Big O and Big Omega, a tight bound on the time.
* Best, Worse, and Expected Case describes Big Theta time for particular inputs.

* O(N): time to process increases linearly with size.
* O(1): time to process remains the same (constant time) regardless of size.
* Others: O(log N), O(N log N), O(N^2), O(2^N), O(N-1)

## Complexity
### Time (Processing)
### Space (Memory)
